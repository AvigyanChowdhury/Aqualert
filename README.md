# Aqualert
•	Created a comprehensive web application that enables citizens to report water-related problems, utilizing cutting-edge technologies such as React JS for the front-end and FastAPI for the back-end, resulting in an efficient and user-friendly platform. 
•	Incorporated Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to automatically categorize and label geo-referenced images, enhancing the accuracy to  80% and more for different classes of water problems ex-Flood, Drainage Problem etc. 
•	Utilized MongoDB as the backend database to store geo-referenced images and their associated location data. This allowed for the compilation of data on a map, facilitating real-time insights and efficient communication with relevant authorities, ultimately improving the responsiveness to water-related issues.
